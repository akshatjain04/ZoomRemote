Test generated by RoostGPT for test MiniProjects using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4-1106-preview

Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic for the `webserver.main` function:

1. **Server Initialization Test Scenario**:
    - Verify that the HTTP server starts successfully on the specified `PORT`.
    - Check that the server prints the starting message with the correct port number.
    - Ensure that the server is running on a separate thread.

2. **Server Thread Test Scenario**:
    - Confirm that the server thread is marked as a daemon thread.
    - Ensure that the server thread is alive after starting the server.
    - Validate that the server thread does not prevent the application from exiting when the main thread terminates.

3. **Request Handler Test Scenario**:
    - Ensure that the `MyRequestHandler` is properly instantiated and passed to the `ThreadingHTTPServer`.
    - Validate that `MyRequestHandler` can handle requests without errors.
    - Check that the request handler is capable of handling concurrent requests due to the threading server.

4. **GUI Initialization Test Scenario**:
    - Confirm that the Tkinter root window is created successfully.
    - Validate that `MyWindow` is instantiated with the correct parameters (e.g., the root window and the IP address).
    - Verify that the window icon is set correctly using the `icon_image` data.

5. **GUI Properties Test Scenario**:
    - Verify that the root window is not resizable as per `root.resizable(False, False)`.

6. **GUI Event Loop Test Scenario**:
    - Check that the main event loop of the Tkinter application starts with `root.mainloop()`.
    - Ensure that the GUI remains responsive to user interactions.

7. **IP Address Helper Function Test Scenario**:
    - Validate that `ip_address_helper` function is called and its return value is used correctly when initializing `MyWindow`.
    - Check that the application handles any exceptions or errors from the `ip_address_helper` function gracefully.

8. **Server Shutdown Test Scenario**:
    - Verify that the HTTP server can be shut down correctly, terminating the `serve_forever` loop.
    - Ensure that the server thread terminates when the server is shut down.

9. **Integration Test Scenario**:
    - Validate that the GUI and HTTP server operate concurrently without interfering with each other.
    - Check that the GUI can trigger actions on the server (if applicable) and that the server can update the GUI (if part of the business logic).

10. **Resource Cleanup Test Scenario**:
    - Ensure that all resources (e.g., network sockets, threads) are properly released when the application exits.
    - Confirm that there are no resource leaks, such as open sockets or non-terminated threads, after the application is closed.

These scenarios are designed to validate the core functionality of the `webserver.main` function. Actual test cases will need to be written to execute these scenarios and assert the expected outcomes.
