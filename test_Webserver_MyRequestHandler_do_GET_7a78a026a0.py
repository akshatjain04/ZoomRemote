================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The server does not sanitize the self.path before using it, which could lead to XSS if user input is reflected on the page.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that self.path does not contain malicious input.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The server uses self.path directly to serve files, which may allow attackers to traverse the file system and access unauthorized files.
Solution: Validate and sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks. Use a secure method to serve files, ensuring paths are restricted to intended directories.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: The code does not implement encryption for data transmission, leaving sensitive information exposed to eavesdropping.
Solution: Use HTTPS by implementing SSL/TLS encryption for the server to protect data in transit.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: The server could be tricked into making arbitrary requests, possibly leaking internal services or files.
Solution: Implement strict input validation and whitelisting of allowed resources to prevent SSRF attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The server may leak information through directory listings or error messages, which can be used by an attacker for reconnaissance.
Solution: Configure the server to not list directory contents and to provide generic error messages that do not reveal sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The code may be running with higher privileges than necessary, which can be exploited if the server is compromised.
Solution: Run the server with the least privilege necessary. Configure proper permissions for files and directories.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The code might be using base64 for encoding sensitive data, which is not a secure form of encryption.
Solution: Replace base64 encoding with a strong encryption algorithm and secure key management practices.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If any part of the code uses randomness for security purposes, it should ensure that it uses a cryptographically secure random number generator.
Solution: Use os.urandom or SystemRandom from the random module for cryptographically secure randomness.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Request to root path
Details:
  TestName: test_request_to_root_path
  Description: This test verifies that the server handles a GET request to the root path '/' correctly by serving the local content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that send_local method is called with the root path '/'.
Validation:
  The root path is a common request, and the server should respond with the appropriate local content. This test ensures that the business logic for handling requests to the root path is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Request to index.html
Details:
  TestName: test_request_to_index_html
  Description: This test verifies that the server correctly serves the 'index.html' local content when requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/index.html'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that send_local method is called with the path '/index.html'.
Validation:
  The 'index.html' is typically the default page for a web server, and the ability to serve it correctly is critical. This test confirms that the server can handle requests to this specific page.

Scenario 3: Request to favicon.ico
Details:
  TestName: test_request_to_favicon_ico
  Description: This test verifies that the server correctly serves the 'favicon.ico' file when requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/favicon.ico'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that send_local method is called with the path '/favicon.ico'.
Validation:
  The favicon.ico is a file that is often requested by browsers, and serving it correctly is important for user experience. This test ensures the server's capability to handle such requests.

Scenario 4: Request to ZoomRemoteDir
Details:
  TestName: test_request_to_zoomremotedir
  Description: This test verifies that the server correctly serves the content of '/ZoomRemoteDir' when requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/ZoomRemoteDir'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that send_local method is called with the path '/ZoomRemoteDir'.
Validation:
  The '/ZoomRemoteDir' may represent a special directory for the application, and it is important to ensure that it is accessible. This test checks that the server responds as expected when this directory is requested.

Scenario 5: Request to an undefined path
Details:
  TestName: test_request_to_undefined_path
  Description: This test verifies that the server correctly delegates the request to the super().do_GET() method when an undefined path is requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/undefined_path'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that the super().do_GET method is called since the path is not one of the predefined paths.
Validation:
  The server should be able to delegate requests that do not match predefined paths to the superclass's method to handle them appropriately. This test ensures that such delegation occurs correctly.

Scenario 6: Request with query parameters to a defined path
Details:
  TestName: test_request_with_query_to_defined_path
  Description: This test verifies that the server correctly serves local content for a defined path even when query parameters are included in the request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of MyRequestHandler with a mocked environment where the path attribute is set to '/index.html?param=value'.
  Act: Call the do_GET method on the MyRequestHandler instance.
  Assert: Check that the send_local method is called with the path '/index.html' ignoring the query parameters.
Validation:
  It is common for requests to include query parameters, and the server should handle such requests correctly by serving the requested local content without being affected by the parameters. This test ensures that the business logic strips query parameters appropriately when serving local content for predefined paths.
