To validate the business logic of the `main` function in the `webserver-cli`, you would need to create test scenarios that cover the expected behavior of the function as well as potential edge cases. Below are several scenarios that you could use to guide the creation of test cases:

1. **Successful Server Start Scenario:**
   - Given the `main` function is invoked,
   - And the `ip_address_helper()` function returns a valid IP address,
   - And the `PORT` is available for binding (i.e., not in use by another application),
   - Then the function should print "Starting HTTP server on [IP_ADDRESS]:[PORT]... Done!" to the console,
   - And the HTTP server should start listening for incoming requests.

2. **Server Start with Custom IP Address Scenario:**
   - Given the `ip_address_helper()` is designed to return a custom IP address when configured,
   - When the `main` function is invoked,
   - Then the function should start the HTTP server on the custom IP address provided by `ip_address_helper()` and the predefined `PORT`.

3. **Port Already in Use Scenario:**
   - Given the `PORT` is already in use by another process,
   - When the `main` function is invoked,
   - Then the function should not be able to bind to the port,
   - And an error should be printed to the console indicating the port is in use.

4. **Invalid IP Address Scenario:**
   - Given the `ip_address_helper()` function returns an invalid IP address,
   - When the `main` function is invoked,
   - Then the function should fail to start the server,
   - And an error should be printed to the console indicating the invalid IP address.

5. **Server Shutdown Scenario:**
   - Given the HTTP server has been started successfully,
   - When a shutdown signal or command is received,
   - Then the `main` function should gracefully shut down the server,
   - And a confirmation message should be printed to the console.

6. **Request Handling Scenario:**
   - Given the HTTP server is running,
   - When a client sends a request to the server,
   - Then the `MyRequestHandler` should handle the request according to the business logic defined in that class.

7. **Server Resilience Scenario:**
   - Given the HTTP server is running,
   - When there is an unhandled exception within `MyRequestHandler`,
   - Then the server should log the exception,
   - And continue to serve other incoming requests without crashing.

8. **Custom Port Configuration Scenario:**
   - Given an environment variable or configuration allows setting a custom port,
   - When the `main` function is invoked with a custom port,
   - Then the HTTP server should start listening on the custom port instead of the predefined `PORT`.

9. **Network Failure Scenario:**
   - Given the server is running,
   - When there is a network failure or disconnection,
   - Then the server should handle the situation gracefully,
   - And attempt to reconnect or provide appropriate feedback to the administrator.

10. **Security Scenario:**
    - Given the server is running,
    - When a request is made that could potentially expose the server to security vulnerabilities (e.g., malformed requests, SQL injection, etc.),
    - Then the `MyRequestHandler` should handle the situation securely and prevent exploitation.

These scenarios cover a range of situations that the `webserver-cli.main` function may encounter, and they provide a basis for developing comprehensive test cases to ensure the reliability and robustness of the web server.

# Test server shutdown scenario (This scenario is hard to test without actual server running)
# For this we need to simulate a server shutdown which usually involves sending a signal to the server process
# We will skip this test as it's outside the scope of unit tests

# Test request handling scenario (This scenario is handled by MyRequestHandler and should be tested separately)

# Test server resilience scenario (This scenario requires an integration test setup with MyRequestHandler)

# Test custom port configuration scenario (This scenario requires an environment setup to test different ports)

# Test network failure scenario (This scenario requires a network simulation environment)

# Test security scenario (This scenario requires security testing tools and is outside the scope of unit tests)

# Note: Some of the scenarios mentioned are not suited for unit testing and should be covered by integration or system tests.
